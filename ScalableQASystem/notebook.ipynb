Common game mechanics include direct kill, deck searching, and improved defense. Many Stark effects are themed around military challenges.\\n* House Lannister, the rich and treacherous residents of Casterly Rock. The Lannister shield is a gold lion on a crimson field. Prominent Lannister characters include Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion Lannister, as well as Ser Gregor Clegane, Ser Addam Marbrand, and Grand Maester Pycelle.

In contrast to her more praised sister Sansa, who favors activities traditionally befitting a noblewoman and expresses disdain for outdoor activities, Arya shows no interest in dancing, singing and sewing, and revels in fighting and exploring, much to the chagrin of her mother and household tutor Septa Mordane.  She is described as \"wolf-blooded\", blunt, impulsive and \"always difficult to tame\" by her mother, and was given the nickname \"Arya Underfoot\" by the guards of Winterfell.  She is particularly close to her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who encourages her to learn how to fight and gives her the smallsword Needle.  The sword is well suited to Arya\\'s slender build and her favored \"Water Dance\" (fencing) style  which emphasizes speed and agility with a thin, light rapier used in quick thrusting attacks.

In an interview, show writer David Benioff explains that Sophie Turner\\'s development as an actress was one of the reasons that they decided to give her character more dramatic scenes, saying, \"Even if child actors come in and do a great audition, it’s so hard to know if they’re going to quite literally grow into the parts. With Sansa and Arya in particular, their storylines have become quite dark.

Due to being held and bred in captivity, their dragons became ever smaller until they finally went extinct. At the beginning of \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\', 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon that deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II \"the Mad King\", and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.\\n\\nThe principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\'.

By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.\\n\\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called ''Avalon''. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 7, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '82c1368aa5fcae44b5cbda7d85f4197f', 'range': (0, 186)}, {'doc_id': '2ab1c9e627da8454e883ec988891dc22', 'range': (1042, 1173)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '943c2b8dde89495b4524b5d7735e965'}>,\n",

Putting ''Avalon'' aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story.

Martin wanted to set this story five years after ''A Storm of Swords'' so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than ''A Storm of Swords'', Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to ''A Clash of Kings''. A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.\\n\\nIn 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002.

Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 44, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '1b80b277fc816a8cd5443294ead612bc', 'range': (0, 227)}, {'doc_id': 'c58cdfc452b1065c38f2eac9d9344f9a', 'range': (988, 1110)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '5d13ee8cae7ddd416925a4dcfce1894'}>,\n",

Robert's brother Renly is convinced by his lover, Ser Loras, that he should be king instead.\\n\\nLittlefinger reveals to Ned that Arryn was searching for Robert's bastards. Ned is ambushed by Jaime Lannister, and claims responsibility for Tyrion's arrest, leading to a brutal fight; Ned's guards are killed, including captain Jory Cassel, and Ned duels Jaime but is speared through the leg.

Samwell Tarly returns to his family\\'s home in Horn Hill, accompanied by Gilly and little Sam; Jaime Lannister attempts to rescue the Queen, Margaery Tyrell; Arya Stark defies the Faceless Men; and Daenerys Targaryen rides on Drogon and emboldens her newly acquired khalasar.\\n\\n\"Blood of My Blood\" was positively received by critics who praised the return of several notable characters, including Benjen Stark, Walder Frey and Edmure Tully. Further praise was given to other plot points, such as Samwell\\'s return to Horn Hill, and Arya\\'s decision to return to being a Stark rather than a disciple of the Many-Faced God. The episode title is a reference to a famous Dothraki saying used between a Khal and his bloodriders. Filming of Bran\\'s visions was put together precisely and also very carefully chosen.
