It is based on ''A Song of Ice and Fire'',  a series of novels written by George R. R. Martin. The first set was Westeros Edition and was released in August 2002. It has since won two Origins Awards. The game's primary designer is Eric Lang, the lead developer is Nate French, with Damon Stone serving as associate designer.\\n\\nIn the game, players assume the leadership of one of the great houses of Westeros vying for control of King's Landing and the Iron Throne. To accomplish this, players launch military attacks against their opponents, undermine their opponents’ plans with intrigues of their own, and make power plays to win the support of the realm.\\n\\n==Factions==\\nEach house represents one of the main factions involved in the struggle for the Iron Throne emulated by the AGoT LCG. Each house provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various play styles to interact within the same game. Certain cards are restricted to one or two houses, giving each house a unique flavor. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '817616288a6b3b410cbf5c61a4ed641f'}>,\n",

In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14 deaths.\\n\\n===Themes===\\n\\nThe series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Martin has stated that \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, \"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.\"In early seasons, under the influence of the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. The series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 4}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '74cc220c964824da93daeb5650fd2d78'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '===Inspirations and derivations===\\nAlthough the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes. According to David Benioff, the series is \"about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way\".\\n\\nThe novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings, characters, and plot on events in European history. Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from lands and cultures, to the palace intrigue, feudal system, castles, and knightly tournaments. A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin\\'s houses of Lannister and Stark. The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"she-wolf of France\" (1295–1358). She and her family, as portrayed in Maurice Druon\\'s historical novel series, \\'\\'The Accursed Kings\\'\\', were a main inspiration of Martin\\'s.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 5}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '1c1e6097ffdea26d243638da25d02461'}>,\n",

The series\\' popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin\\'s skill at fusing these elements into a seamless, credible version of alternate history.

The character has received critical acclaim, including praise as the 4th greatest character in the series by ''Rolling Stone''. She and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
